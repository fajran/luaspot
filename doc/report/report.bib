  abstract =	"Sensor networks are increasingly being deployed for a
		 wide variety of tasks. One open problem in these
		 networks is the development, deployment, and
		 maintenance of applications. Today, these tasks are
		 performed largely ad-hoc because of the severe
		 constraints imposed by the limitations in processing
		 power, communication bandwidth, and memory capacity of
		 the sensor nodes. Existing platforms help somewhat but
		 also introduce implicit trade-offs. On the one hand,
		 low-level programming platforms and languages make
		 programming cumbersome and error-prone. On the other
		 hand, declarative approaches greatly facilitate
		 programming but severely restrict what can be done. In
		 both cases, additional limitations include lack of
		 support for concurrency, difficulties in changing
		 applications, and insufficient abstractions from
		 low-level details. This paper presents SwissQM, a
		 virtual machine designed to address all these
		 limitations. SwissQM offers a platform-independent
		 programming abstraction that is geared towards data
		 acquisition and in-network data processing. Compared
		 with low-level platforms and languages, SwissQM offers
		 a better abstraction for programming sensor networks
		 and interacting with high-level applications. Compared
		 with declarative query-based approaches, SwissQM offers
		 more flexibility and support for customisation.",
